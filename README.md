newPortfolio
============

Written in HTML, CSS and jQuery

New update coming in the next couple months is a brand new layout complete with more module pop ups, my various work, side work and hackathon work I am also creating companies under me that will be showcased here. However this will be less and less a link, and the other links will be where all the important things are. 

There are a lot of exciting things happening.
